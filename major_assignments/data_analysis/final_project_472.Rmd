```

```{r cars}
wapo_po_shooting <- read.csv("fatal-police-shootings-data (3).csv")
```

```{r}

  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

age_victim

```

```{r}

  group_by(flee == "Not fleeing") %>%
  filter(age > 20, age < 40) %>%

  )
  
  
```

```{r}

Question: What is the average age range of victims? There seems to be a lot of middle-aged victims in this database. Why?

Answer: In this data, there is a trend of victims being around the ages of 20-35 years old. After filtering through the data specifically about 20-35 year olds, it showed that the top state with the most police shooting victims (aged 20-35) are California. The city of Los Angeles has the most victims aged 20-35 with a count of 62 shootings. According to this LA Times article (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-10-15/string-of-recent-lapd-shootings-pushes-2021-count-beyond-2020-2019-totals%3f_amp=true), homicide ratings have increased up to 46% since 2019. 

For all the victims around the ages of 20-35, almost 2000 victims were recorded as 'not fleeing' while on the scene, where as 1628 were said to have fleed the scene.
